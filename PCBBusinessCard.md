# Business card PCB

I was playing around with PCB layers and found myself designing a PCB business card. I have never been this eager to get PCB boards like this time.

Here are the front and backside of how the PCB looks like

## Analysis

### Sim card

I placed the sim card pad there for show off. I was trying to copy the pad on the Debit or Credit cards. It doesn't work and if you try it on an ATM or PDQ machine I am not liable.

### QR code

Instead of adding your website name as silkscreen, I added a QR code that when you scan, it can automatically send you to my [website](rodneyosodo.com).
I plan in the future to use a copper layer instead of a silkscreen when drawing the QR code.
I will also add a top solder mask layer underneath the copper layer to increase its definition. This can be demonstrated in the email text.
I added traces beneath to provide some feel to the PCB.

### Printing

Instead of using the top silk layer I will change it to coper and add the top solder mask layer. This increases the definition and makes the text silver as the email address.
I will also try out different font styles.

### Nairobi outline

This is wonderful. Probably in the future revisions I will remove the copper track that passes through.

### NFC

This is to add more functionality. If your phone has NFC you can read the chip and it will send you directly to my website. Currently, the NFC is not in all the business cards.

In the future, I intend to use Electro-less Nickel / Immersion Gold (ENIG) surface finish as it offers a flat surface, is lead-free and RoHS compliant, longer shelf life, and looks better. I will also reduce the copper thickness to around 0.8mm. Since JLCPCB uses a white silkscreen on a black PCB that will remain constant.

I will be attending PyConKE22 on the 6th and 7th of May 2022 and I will share these boards. Hope my friends enjoy some little piece of Rodney in their lives
