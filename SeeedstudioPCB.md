## Lessons learnt
1. This was my first SMT Stencil order so I am looking forward to the components arriving so that I could be able to solder them
2. At the cost of USD$4.90 you get 10 boards in my case if you decide to panelise the boards you even get more boards
3. The customer service with Seeed Studio is top-notch. I was in contact with one of their representatives the whole time.
4. I even got a picture of how my PCBs looked before they shipped them.
