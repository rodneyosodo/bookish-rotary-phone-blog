# JKUATSESTechWeek 1.1
Words can't describe how exhilarating this event was. Every moment is quite vivid in my brain and I can still relieve it. Okay, enough with flattering. Let's organise our thought compass and unfold each moment chronologically.

## Before

Unfortunately being this was our first event to conduct we didn't know so much. One of the major setbacks we encountered was financing for the event. We sent out emails to respective sponsors 4 weeks before the event. We didn't expect much. To our surprise, some of the JKUAT SES alumni and alumnae managed to chip in on the budget and sent out their generous contributions. With 2 weeks to the event, we didn't know where we could get the funds. Luckily Microsoft and Africastalking replied to our email saying they would be able to provide monetary and speaker support. This was great. Really great. As one of the major hurdles had been jumped.

Within a week our slots for attendees has been full, as were could be able to accommodate 100 attendees. On the speaker side, it was a bit fretting. With time the slots filled up and I volunteered to give two talks. We come back to this later.

On the hackathon side, everything was going on well with teams changing their chassis up to the last week. Since most of the hackathon participants were my classmates it was easier to share books and how to actually develop a fast line following robot. 

Coming up to this week, this event made us realise some of the key things we, JKUATSES, might be lacking. This was a good opportunity as at the end of the tunnel we were able to resolve these issues. We were able to design new merchandise for JKUATSES and this was quite fulfilling as it gave most of us a sense of home away from home.

## Day 1

I will relieve my organising committee duties and narrate as an attendee. 

The morning of day one was quite chilly. I definitely knew the gods were on our side. Most of the things went as planned apart from a few hiccups here and there. We were graced to have Kelvin Ndemo a GitHub student ambassador doubling in as a software developer in Twiga foods. Also, we have our alumni Ephantus Ngugi who works at Gearbox. They kicked off the day on a high note and we were pleased to have them. The morning sessions were impressive just to mention a few talks;
1. PCB design from Chrispine Tinega from JKUAT SES
2. Cloud functions from Josh Cardiff from Microsoft
In the afternoon I had my first talk under the structural track, computation fluid dynamics. here I was able to brief the attendees on how to carry out a CFD study with our case study Nakuja N1 Airframe. This is was our first model rocket we flew with the Nakuja teams.
Other talks in the afternoon were;
1. Software Control from Felix Wanyoike from JKUAT SES
2. Building IoT systems with Kennedy Otieno from Africa's Talking
3. Embedded systems from Calvin Mwadime. Here we explored the embedded system in the Voyager spacecraft.
I finished the day with a talk on building the JKUAT SES development board. I must say it was quite an exhausting day.

## Day 2

Rest is paramount to any human being but to me, it was evitable as I had to participate the following day in a line following robot. I spent a better part of the night soldering some broken connections and getting our robot, Ludwing, ready for the next day. My team was comprised of Ian Kibandi and Steve Munene both my classmates. We hadn't implemented any control to our program at first but found another control system, name not mentioned so that you don't laugh at how dumb we were. Fortunately, in the first track, we were able to finish the race fastest but lost ours on the second track which consisted of three laps. We managed to finish at the second position behind Sammy Oina and in front of Michael Kimani, Washington Kamandi and Felix Wanyoike and Spencer Mogire. I guess this challenge was able to show us some insights on how we will tackle our final year projects.

### What Motivated Me to take part in JKUATSESTechWeek

I believe that with engineering we can make the world a better place by building products that empower and motivate lives. The purpose behind this event was to overcome today's challenge for a better tomorrow.

## Most Memorable Moment

When I entered the room, I immediately felt everyone‚Äôs energy and excitement. One of the most memorable moments was when Bundi and Nakuja came and talked to us about their mission and some of the key issues they are currently facing. It was such a motivating moment and sparked even more ideas.
The free swag, food, and new friends of course made the experience even more memorable.

## Thank You Note

I am grateful to have been a part of this event, as an organiser, as a speaker and as an attendee. One of the ways to build one skill is participating in such events. I did that in every way possible. 

Thanks to the JKUATSES community, JKUAT, and our sponsors, Microsoft, Africastalking, Elarian and Moringa. A special shout out to the organising committee and JKUAT SES alumni and alumnae for making this event, JKUATSESTechWeek on experience so memorable and motivating.
